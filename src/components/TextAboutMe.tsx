        After dedicating years to pursuing my finance degree, I came to the
        realization that it wasn't the career path I wanted for my future.
        Instead, I decided to follow my passion and explore coding.

      <Text>
        To my delight, I discovered a deep love for programming, and I've since
        honed my developer skills to a confident level. Now, I am eagerly
        anticipating the opportunity to collaborate and work together with you.
